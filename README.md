# McLeod-Group-data-workflows

This repository was set up to centralise several data workflows used by the McLeod group to undergo untargeted metabolomic analysis. 

To use any of the workflows (or parts thereof) in any public or private material please seek premission from the McLeod group (RSC, ANU) and/or Christopher Fitzgerald. 

For Publication purposes please reference, Dr. Christopher Charles Jung-Hua Fitzgerald (OrcID 0000-0003-3935-4300) and Professor Malcolm D. McLeod (OrcID 0000-0002-2343-3226). 

There are several workflows contained with in this repository that serve different functions to do with targeted and untargeted metabolomics. An example of the workflows has been demonstrated in the following publication, Profiling Urinary Sulfate Metabolites With Mass Spectrometry, @https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2022.829511. 

Please be considerate when using the workflows.
