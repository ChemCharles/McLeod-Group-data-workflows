# Export files for Metaboanalyst 5.0####
# This code is designed to take the output from the Kmeans data and re-format it so it can be used in MetaboAnalyst 5.0.

#Instructions for MetaboAnalyst 

# The output data file is formatted to 'fit' into MetaboAnalyst5.0's Statistical Analysis (One factor) GUI on their website. 
# In this GUI mutliple analysis' can be done such as, PCA, PLS, OPLS-DA, Heatmaps, dendrograms, volcano-plots, and T-test.
